/**
 * Market settlement via the registered-app contract (#2740, kernel #2642/#2695).
 *
 * Two halves, both authenticated with market's OWN app-service token
 * (`getAppServiceToken`) — no shared pay key:
 *
 *  1. `buildPayeeChain` — at purchase time, resolve the listing's .fair manifest
 *     chain into absolute dollar amounts. The purchase route sends it to pay's
 *     `/api/checkout` as `payeeManifest`, which binds the payment to market's app
 *     DID and records the payees the kernel will later verify against.
 *  2. `settleListingPurchase` — once the purchase webhook reports the payment,
 *     `POST /api/settle` with the `transaction_id` that checkout returned and
 *     exactly that recorded chain as `fair_manifest`. A replay of an
 *     already-settled payment (`alreadySettled: true`) counts as success.
 *
 * The chain sums to the GROSS payment: the kernel takes the payer, amount,
 * currency and rail from its own payment record and requires
 * `Σchain == recorded total`, so no processing-fee estimate is deducted here
 * (the pre-#2642 flow posted a fee-reduced chain and a caller-chosen total).
 *
 * Settlement failure is non-fatal — the listing has already been updated.
 * A listing without a .fair manifest chain is never settled.
